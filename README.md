# ChessBot
A simple chess engine currently supporting 1v1 local play with a text-based console UI.

Instructions:
Clone the repository into a folder.

Run Chess.py in Python3

You will be prompted to select an agent for each side.  A player agent is a human controlled side, and the others are different AI algorithms.

For human move input, enter the move as a pair of coordinates in standard chess format, such as:

E2 E4

Would move the piece at E2 to E4 (could be a pawn at the start of the game)



Future plans include:

Implementing AI enemy using various algorithms such as minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax, and others

Adding visually appealing AI
